This is a project exemplifying the model and controller aspects of Model-View-Controller design of Object-Oriented Programming through the use of the game Marble Solitaire.

The program allows the user to run a game of Marble Solitaire from the console using command line arguments which specify the version and potentially the size and/or position of the first empty space.

Once intiated, the user can play a game by entering two integers representing the position on the board of the marble to be moved, and the location to which it should be moved. If an invalid location or move is entered, the user will be prompted to reenter the move. Everytime a move is made the console will display an updated gameboard and the current score.
